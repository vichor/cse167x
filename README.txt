About
-----
This is the repository where I store the homeworks done for the CSE167x Computer Graphics course from UC San DiegoX, hosted at EDX website.

Course page: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+CSE167x+2T2018/course/

License
-------
The code I have written down is free for everyone to use. But I have written really a very limited amount of code (right now, only Transform.cpp contents). 
The rest the code has been downloaded from the course material and I don't know which kind of license it has. Please, contact the course responsibles to get
licensing details before using the code.

Note: I am assuming that, at least, the license grants me permission to upload the code to github.
